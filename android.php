              <em>Need help with Android-phone, 
                   in that case, we are best but here is some simple troubleshooting 
                   that you can do at home:</em><br/><br/>
                   <strong>IF Power and volume button stops working</strong>: 
                   As with many of the initial problems of the phone, a simple reset should solve the issue. 
                   That might sound counter-automatic given the nature of this problem, but it works. 
                   While the power and volume buttons might appear unresponsive, holding the power &amp;
                    home buttons together should still reset some phones. 
               On the occasion, when your phone gets to start again, the power and volume
                buttons should be active again.
            </p>
               <p  style="font-size:20px; line-height:30px;">
               <strong>IF Oversensitive screen</strong>. 
               We have seen some users protesting that the layout is so unstable and 
               that the palm-elimination character is not doing its job of refining out 
               random presses around the edges of the display. It can also cause issues
                when exciting the phone an in a particular way whilst trying to take a picture, 
               with the shutter button proving unresponsive, moreover when trying to type out 
               a message on the keyboard.              
             </p>
                <p  style="font-size:20px; line-height:30px;">
               <strong>IF the phone gets Overheating. </strong>
                Some users are complaining that their phones are getting too hot while charging. 
                In this case, it could simply be down to the fact that youâ€™re using the phone while 
                it is charging. We will recommend that. please stop doing that.
                </p>

                <strong>Camera failed</strong>. 
                If you are one who is experiencing the Warning which states Camera Failed, try a hard reset by holding
                 down the Home &amp; Power buttons at the same time until you feel the phone vibrate and restart. If 
                 it is still not working then go to Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Application manager and open the Camera app.
                  Tap Force Stop and then go to the Storage menu and select Clear Data and Clear Cache.
                </p>
                <p  style="font-size:20px; line-height:30px;">
                  <strong> Bluetooth connection issues</strong>. 
                  There is one trick that can fix this issue.<br>Go to Settings &gt; 
                      Apps&gt; Apps manager then tap More and then select Show system apps. 
                Now if you scroll down you should see an app called Bluetooth Share. Tap it to open.
